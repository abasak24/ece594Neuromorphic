# ece594Neuromorphic
Graph Processing on Neuromorphic Hardware

## Instructions on Datasets
* We used three datasets for our evaluation located in "datasets" folder. Please use the .txt files with eights included.

## Instructions to run the software simulaton
* python src/SSSPWithPath.py ../datasets/smallKroneckerWeighted.txt 32
* Specify the path to datasets 
* Specify the total number of nodes in the graph 

## Final Project Report and Slides (Due Dec 4)
* Report -> Abanti created overleaf with editable link: https://www.overleaf.com/4985316468bznhwzwftyjk
* Slides -> Abanti created Google slides and sent invitations to team mates. 

## Dataset creation
* Abanti created a dataset folder with small synthetic datasets. 

## Brian python simulation:
* Abanti wrote and tested neuromorphic SSSP on a small graph. 
* Another teammate will write a baseline CPU SSSP to produce reference outputs for checking correctness of neuromorphic SSSP.

## FPGA simulation:
* Kenny will work on it. 

## Project Proposal (due Nov 14) (DONE):
* Abanti opened an overleaf latex repo and here is the editable link: https://www.overleaf.com/3789364254dhcjnxgschrx
* Abanti will take care of writing the project proposal and ask for help from others for editing, reviewing, writing any specific section, and any suggestions for change.
