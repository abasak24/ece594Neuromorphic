# ece594Neuromorphic
Graph Processing on Neuromorphic Hardware

## Project Proposal (due Nov 14):
* Abanti opened an overleaf latex repo and here is the editable link: https://www.overleaf.com/3789364254dhcjnxgschrx
* Abanti will take care of writing the project proposal and ask for help from others for editing, reviewing, writing any specific section, and any suggestions for change. 

## Dataset creation
* Abanti created a dataset folder with small synthetic datasets 

## Brian python simulation:
* Abanti and Shreyansh will start to work on it. 

## FPGA simulation:
Kenny will work on it. 

## Final Report and Slides 

## Running CPU baseline (may be not needed anymore)
* Abanti will run CPU baseline: optimized graph algorithms on some datasets.
