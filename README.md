# ece594Neuromorphic
Course Project

## Project Proposal (due Nov 14):
* Abanti opened an overleaf latex repo and here is the editable link:https://www.overleaf.com/3789364254dhcjnxgschrx
* Abanti will take care of writing the project proposal and ask for help from others for editing, reviewing, writing any specific section, and any suggestions for change. 

## Running CPU baseline
* Abanti will run CPU baseline: optimized graph algorithms on some datasets. 

## Brian simulation/Reproducing neuromorphic system in previous work:
* Kenny will start reproducing the work in previous paper: https://sc18.supercomputing.org/proceedings/workshops/workshop_files/ws_pmes104s1-file1.pdf

## Finding a partitioning algorithm:
* Abanti read the following paper presenting an experimental study of different partitioning algorithms on CPUs: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3269471
* Abanti will think further about what partitioning scheme is the best to use.
