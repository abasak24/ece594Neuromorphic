# Dataset Description 
Creator -> Abanti
* .txt files representing small graphs 
* genereted synthetically
* Kronecker and unirform random graphs 
* two files for each type -> one is weighted, other in unweighted
* file format for unweighted -> source ID, destination ID
* file for mat for weighted -> source ID, destination ID, weighted
* We may not need the weighted files, but let's just keep them for the moment
* smallKronecker.txt -> Kronecker graph, 32 nodes and 157 undirected edges 
* smallKroneckerWeighted.txt -> weighted version of smallKronecker.txt
* smallUR.txt -> uniform random graph, 32 nodes, 316 undirected edges 
* smallURWeighted.txt -> weighted version of smallUR.txt
