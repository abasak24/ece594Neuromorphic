# Dataset Description 
Creator -> Abanti
* .txt files representing small graphs 
* genereted synthetically
* Kronecker and uniform random graphs 
* two files for each type -> one is weighted, other iS unweighted
* file format for unweighted -> source ID, destination ID
* file format for weighted -> source ID, destination ID, weight
* We may not need the weighted files, but let's just keep them for the moment
* smallKronecker.txt -> Kronecker graph, 32 nodes and 157 undirected edges (which basically means 314 edges in total) 
* smallKroneckerWeighted.txt -> weighted version of smallKronecker.txt
* smallUR.txt -> uniform random graph, 32 nodes, 316 undirected edges (which basically means 632 edges in total) 
* smallURWeighted.txt -> weighted version of smallUR.txt
